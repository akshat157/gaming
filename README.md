Just a repository to store all of my game config files.


## Usage
#### CS:GO
1. Download and paste the file to the following directory.
```
<Path to steamapps>\common\Counter-Strike Global Offensive\csgo\cfg
```
2. Open the ingame console and run the following command.
```
exec csgo_config
```
Note: `csgo_config` is the name of the config file so make sure to change it accordingly if you rename it after downloading.
